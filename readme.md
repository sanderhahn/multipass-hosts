# Multipass Hosts

Small utility that generates or updates the hosts file with your multipass vm names and ip addresses.
This allows accessing the vm locally using its name instead of its dynamically assigned ip address.
Additionally its possible to define aliasses that allow a vm to be accessible using multiple names.
When multipass assigns new ip addresses to vms you can rerun the tool to update the hosts configuration.

## Installation

The utility can be installed when Go is available using:

```bash
go get github.com/sanderhahn/multipass-hosts
```

The tool needs to be executed as root so that it is able to overwrite the `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
# always run multipass-hosts as root
sudo chmod +s `which multipass-hosts`
sudo chown root:root `which multipass-hosts`
```

On Windows it updates the `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file when executed as Administrator.

## Aliasses

This is possible by using aliasses that are read from the `$HOME/.multipass-hosts.json` file using the format:

```json
{
    "aliasses": {
        "gitlab": [
            "gitlab.example.com",
            "example.io",
            "root.example.io",
            "repository.example.com"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Implementation

The tool executes `multipass list --format json` and extracts the name and ipv4 fields.
These ip addresses are added into the `hosts` file surrounded with comments that mark the start and end of the block.
